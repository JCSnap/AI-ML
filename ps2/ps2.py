# Thus, the number of moves needed is bounded by number of wrong tiles / max(row_diff, col_diff), (this is the case where all the wrong tiles are in a position such that they can be fixed with the min cost)

    Hill climbing with random restarts finds the solution to reach the goal from the initial.

        cities (int): The number of cities to be visited
        
        distances (List[Tuple[int]]): The list of distances between every two cities
            Each distance is represented as a tuple in the form of (c1, c2, d), where
                c1 and c2 are the two cities and d is the distance between them.
            The length of the list should be equal to cities * (cities - 1)/2.

        repeats (int): The number of times hill climbing to be repeated. The default
            value is 10.
